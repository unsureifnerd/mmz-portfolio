## About This Portfolio

This is not a traditional portfolio.

It's an experimental space that rejects conventional design rules - intentionally chaotic, misaligned, and unpredictable. Everything here is chaos by design, not by accident.

**Philosophy:**
> Mozammil does not work in straight lines. He moves between ideas unpredictably, driven by impulse, curiosity, and experimentation. Projects appear, shift direction, collide into each other, or vanish without warning. To him, that is not chaos by accident — it is chaos by design.
